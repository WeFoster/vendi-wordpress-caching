== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin affiliated with Wordfence? =

The authors of this plugin are not affiliated with Wordfence. The caching engines used by this plugin were ported from Wordfence's code after they decided to remove them from their codebase.

= Does this plugin replace Wordfence? =

No, but it does replace a feature that they will be removing soon. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/">Wordfence</a> is one of the best security plugins available for WordPress and for about 2 years their product included a very awesome caching engine. In October of 2016 they decided that they would be removing this caching engine which is why this plugin was created.
